# Capestone_portal
Capstone Supervisor Allocation portal is a student-supervisor interface which allows the communication between the student and the supervisor through the online medium. The user side interface as well as the supervisor interface portal is designed in the project giving the ease to both the sides of interacting with each other. These Capstone Projects are hands-on projects that let you apply what youâ€™ve learned in a specialization to a practical question or problem related to the specialization topic. Some Specializations end with a capstone project. Others include projects throughout the specialization.
